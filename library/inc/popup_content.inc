            <p>Taiwan is an island country. Although it is surrounded by the sea, its people fear the sea since the politics, the history and the religious beliefs held on this island make people turn their backs to the sea.</p>
            <p>Oceanic literature author Liao Hung-chi and underwater photographer Ray CHIN lead the audience out to the sea and into the water. They prompt us to understand the sea and to think about the possibility that the ocean might become our lives and the future of our country.</p>
            <p>Taiwan is not only an island but also a sleeping whale. Since a whale does not belong to the land, it has to wake up and swim towards its future full of possibilities.</p>

        <div class="intro">
            <p>The film narrates the political history of Taiwan over a period of 50 years, following the imposition of martial law in 1947 and ‘The White Terror.’ Suspected of being a leftist, KO spent around 30 years in prison and institutions, always obsessively worrying about the fate of his best friend CHEN executed in the 1950s. Their friendship and CHEN's fate is chronicled in flashback. Soon after his release, KO goes in search of the truth and a part of himself. Only when he learns the truth is he able to pay his respects.</p>
            <p>This intense and sad film depicts the mind of KO as he wanders back and forth through time and space, history and the city, memory and reality. Using an idealistic political prisoner from the 50s to form a poignant contrast with the corrupt politicians of the 90s, WAN thrusts the motifs of “introspection” and “redemption” to the poetic summit using thick and heavy brush strokes, resulting in a great artistic achievement.</p>

A scene from the ritualistic dance piece Miroirs de Vie (2006), created by internationally renowned choreographer LIN Lee-Chen and performed by her Legend Lin Dance Theatre. LIN has devoted her life to creating work that blends modern dance with religious ritual. Drawing from her own life, LIN turns her outlook into a calming physical strength in her choreography, giving the audience a chance to glimpse her inner strength and creativity.</p>
            <p>Filmed over the course of ten years, this documentary is a poetic expression of the persistence and creativity of LIN Lee-Chen, capturing the internationally renowned choreographer’s meditations on life itself. Exquisite images of layered cloth and the contours of dancers’ bodies during the ritualistic performances enable the audience to explore the choreography with a tactile eye, while LIN reflects on her attitudes towards dance and aesthetics. Unlike much Western dance that emphasizes speed, LIN’s oriental aesthetic emphasizes the slowness of body movement and a reflexivity towards slowness itself.</p>

            <p>Colorrblind girl A-Kuei feels alienated and misunderstood. She is raised by her grandmother who would rather believe she is possessed than hear her feelings. The only person in the village who understands her is her bookworm cousin A-Hsien. He tells her that there is an island far away in the South Pacific where everyone is also colorblind due to a genetic mutation. As A-Kuei develops a hazy affection for A-Hsien, she begins to discover his secrets. Both teens long to escape from their remote seaside village, travel far away to a place where they can find unbridled happiness and truly be themselves.</p>
            <p>Director FU's debut feature is a quirky and colorful coming-of-age story that tackles issues of grandparenting, single-parent families and a young girl's sense of alienation through the metaphor of colorblindness. Building on its perceptive character sketches, authentic performances and compassionate representation of its rustic coastal setting, with more ambitiously imaginative sequences, even interating animation, the film departs from traditionally realistic Taiwanses films to create something more playful, childlike and magical.</p>

        <div class="intro">
            <p>A car accident involving a stray dog connects unlikely characters with life-changing results. A hand model caught in an estranged middle-class marriage, tries to recover from the loss of her baby, but neither religion nor extramarital affairs can help her. A poor aboriginal couple resort to God to get rid of their alcohol problems, transport top-class peaches to the city and hope to reunite with their daughters. A one-legged truck driver collects abandoned deity statues hoping to be blessed with a new prosthetic. Some of them will face a surprising turn in life, others will be caught in new dilemmas.</p>
            <p>This multi-character rhapsody evokes the pluralism of community, class and religion, as well as their conflicts, in contemporary Taiwan. Contrasting values permeate the film: deities are reduced to objects worshipped to gain fortune, and expensive peaches discarded after a commercial shoot are poor people’s only source of income. Diverse characters with different social positions and life experiences, are nevertheless united as wandering minds in search of spiritual redemption amid the impermanence of life.</p>

            <p>This frothy Taiwanese-dialect comedy was LI Hsing’s directorial debut. It showcases Taiwan’s scenery in the 1950s and features relatable characters based on Hollywood’s classic comedy duo, Laurel and Hardy. The film score was composed by acclaimed composer ZHOU Lan-ping, whose playful music coupled with the actors’ slapstick action renders this amazing comedy. ZHOU later composed for many notable films including the star-crossed musical The Love Eterne (1963) and two martial arts classics Come Drink with Me (1966) and Dragon Inn (1967).</p>

            <p>“Taromak” is located in Taitung, Taiwan, meaning “land of warriors” in Rukai language. Due to the change of generations, the new chieftain Gu is now faced with a severe crisis to pass on the traditional culture and to strengthen solidarity between peoples. In order to seek the story of Taromak, the filmmaker visited the local indigenous community over two years, recording Gu’s self-searching journey to recover his lost identity as well as his sincere hope to rebuild the remains of the long-lost millet tradition.</p>
            <p>The documentary functions not merely as a visual record, but as an intermediary between Taromak descendants, closely following their steps and presenting the spiritual connection with them to nature, forest, soil and most importantly to the precious Taromak tradition.</p>

            <p>Both shorts are set in Taromak Village, a Rukai indigenous community located close to Taiwan’s southeast coast. Styling themselves “children of the sun,” the people of Taromak live by an ancient wisdom: “Culture is daily life.” About Taromak Eco-logy: With spatiotemporal coordinates defined by plants and animals, the sun’s children have built ta-romak, literally “our home,” on a sustainable ecological base. They believe every herb, bloom, fruit, bird, and beast is an amulet from the ancestors. Hence, Taromak is not just their home. Any home has rules, and only by following these rules, including traditional taboos, can the sun’s children find the way home and bear witness to the wisdom of the ancestors. Taromak Millet-ology is about the traditional food abay, millet. For the audience, it’s an initiation into an ancient mystery, a golden secret. It’s also an invitation to see the sustainable Rukai way of life, and the ecosystem which it constitutes, in a single millet grain. The Rukai reflect on their relation to this grain during the millet festival, when young men are refined into warriors who can join hands with the girls they love and compose an ode to the joy of life.</p>
